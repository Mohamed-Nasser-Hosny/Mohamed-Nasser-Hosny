My name is Mohamed Nasser, a mechatronics enginner who graduated from the German university in Cairo (GUC), i have a passion for Embedded systems and control theory.
I am interested in further advancing my skills in Embedded systems as well as Control theory, however i am also keen to learning more about power systems, especially 
those related to renewable energy systems, such as wind turbines and Solar power, and i am keen on learning the various topics related to them.
